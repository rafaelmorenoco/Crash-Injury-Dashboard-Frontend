    A year after installation, most Automated Safety Cameras (ASC) issue 25–50% fewer tickets than in their first year. The installations analyzed go from 2019 through 2022.

    Over the past decade, the District’s ASC program has expanded from 153 in 2015 to 547 in 2025. This program promotes accountability for dangerous driving, contributes to traffic calming by reducing speeding, and makes DC roads safer to walk, bike, and drive.

    ASC data shows that nearly 60% of vehicles with a violation had only one all year in FY24 and FY25. Meaning, most drivers make a mistake once and then correct it.
