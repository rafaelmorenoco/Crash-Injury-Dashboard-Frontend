### Tips:
- For numbered streets, keep the ordinal attached directly to the number without spaces (e.g., "14TH ST NW" is correct, while "14 TH ST NW" is not).
- Always include the road type after the name or number, followed by the quadrant (e.g., "PENNSYLVANIA AVE NW").
- Donâ€™t use "and" for intersections; always use "&" (e.g., "14TH ST NW & PENNSYLVANIA AVE NW").
