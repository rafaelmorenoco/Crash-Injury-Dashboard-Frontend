<script>
  // Evidence has no API for one input to write to another (Dropdown reads its
  // initial state once, then owns $inputs[name]), so a map click cannot set the
  // street dropdowns. Instead we latch the map's selection into a plain variable.
  // It survives intersection_map reloading (which is what resets the map input
  // when you change severity/road user/date), so the selection sticks.
  // SQL blocks are compiled to JS template literals in component scope, so
  // the map_key variable below is usable directly inside the SQL blocks.
  // NOTE: must be `var`, not `let`. Evidence injects the compiled SQL blocks
  // ABOVE this script, so a `let` here would be in the temporal dead zone and
  // the whole page fails to construct. `var` hoists, so map_key is simply
  // undefined until this line runs -- which the SQL below tolerates.
