    2020 Speed Limit Reduction & Innovation During the Pandemic </span>

    **“20 Is Plenty” and Lowered Speed Limits**: Mayor Bowser announced plans to permanently lower the default speed limit on all of the District’s streets to 20 mph unless otherwise signed. Thousands of miles of local street speed limits were reduced from 25 mph to 20 mph.

    ---
    **Annual Safety Program (ASaP)**: DDOT initiated its annual safety program that rapidly deploys multimodal safety improvements at data-driven priority locations across the District each year. To date, ASaP has improved safety at hundreds of locations, using a data-driven approach.
    ---
    **Fatal Crash Follow-Ups**: DDOT and MPD began following up on each fatal crash with a site visit and the identification of any short-term measures to improve safety for all roadway users. Memos outlining the site visit findings and follow-up are posted online.

    2024 Intensified Enforcement </span>

    **High Visibility Enforcement by MPD**: The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of Washington, DC, intensified its high visibility traffic safety enforcement efforts—such as Operation Safeguard and Traffic Safety Compliance Checkpoints—to promote safe driving, educate motorists, and remove impaired or unsafe drivers from the roads, aligning with the City’s Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries.
    ---
    **Expansion of Booting and Towing Operations**: The DPW intensified its efforts against traffic violators by booting 3,323 vehicles and towing 411 cars in 2024, resulting in nearly $11.7 million in collected fines. This crackdown targeted vehicles with significant unpaid fines and those posing safety risks due to violations like fake or expired tags, which prevent effective enforcement of safe driving laws. To accommodate the increased enforcement actions, DPW opened a new impound lot, boosting the city’s vehicle storage capacity by 30%. This facility supports the ongoing efforts to remove dangerous and non-compliant vehicles from District streets.
